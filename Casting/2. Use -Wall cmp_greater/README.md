## 🚀 Introduction

In C++, comparing **signed** and **unsigned** integers can lead to **unexpected behavior** and often triggers compiler warnings.

This README explains:

* Why this warning occurs.
* How to avoid dangerous comparisons.
* The role of the `-Wall` flag.
* How to use `cmp_greater` from C++20 to safely handle such cases.

## ⚡ The Problem: Signed vs. Unsigned Comparison

When you compare an `int` (signed) to an `unsigned int`, **the signed integer is implicitly converted to unsigned.**

This can produce surprising results:

* Negative signed integers can become large positive unsigned integers after conversion.
* The comparison can always seem to pass or fail incorrectly.

⚙️ **Compiler Warning Example:**

```sh
warning: comparison of integer expressions of different signedness: 'int' and 'unsigned int' [-Wsign-compare]
```

## 🖥️ Example Explanation

```cpp
int main() {
    int result = 65;
    unsigned char c = result;
    std::cout << (int)c << std::endl; // Outputs 65

    int i = -2;
    unsigned int u = 1;

    if (i > u) {
        std::cout << "huh?" << std::endl; // output: huh?
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### ✅ What Happens:

* `i > u` → The **signed int `i` (-2)** is converted to **unsigned int**.
* `-2` as an unsigned integer → becomes a very large number (due to two's complement representation).
* This leads to incorrect comparison logic.

---

## 🔍 The Role of `-Wall`

The `-Wall` flag:

```sh
g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -o prog -Wall
```

* Enables **all important warnings**.
* Helps catch potentially dangerous operations like **signed vs. unsigned comparisons.**

💡 Always compile with `-Wall` to get early warnings.

## 🛡️ Solution Using `cmp_greater` (C++20)

The safe, modern way to compare values with different signedness is to use the `cmp_greater` function from the C++20 `<utility>` header.

### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    int i = -2;
    unsigned int u = 1;

    if (std::cmp_greater(i, u)) {
        std::cout << "Safe huh?" << std::endl;// won't be printed.
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### ✅ Why it's better:

* `std::cmp_greater` safely compares mixed signed/unsigned values **without silent conversions.**
* The compiler won't warn because it’s type-safe.

---

## 💡 Best Practices

* Always compile with `-Wall`.
* Avoid mixing signed and unsigned types in comparisons.
* Use **`std::cmp_*` functions** (`cmp_equal`, `cmp_less`, `cmp_greater`, etc.) in C++20 for type-safe comparisons.
* Consider using **`std::make_unsigned`** if you need manual type adjustments.
